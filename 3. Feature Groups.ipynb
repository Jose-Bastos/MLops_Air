    "A feature group can be seen as a collection of conceptually related features that are computed together at the same cadence. In your case, you will create a feature group for the transaction data and a feature group for the windowed aggregations on the transaction data. Both will have `tid` as primary key, which will allow you to join them together to  create training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature groups provide a namespace for features, so two features are allowed to have the same name as long as they belong to different feature groups. For instance, in a real-life setting we would likely want to experiment with different window lengths. In that case, we can create feature groups with identical schema for each window length.\n",
